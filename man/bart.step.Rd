\usage{
bart.step(
  x.data,
  y.data,
  ri.data = NULL,
  iter.step = 100,
  tree.step = 10,
  iter.plot = 100,
  full = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.data}{A data frame of covariates}

\item{y.data}{A vector of outcomes (1/0)}

\item{iter.step}{How many BART models to run for each iteration of the
stepwise reduction}

\item{tree.step}{How many trees to use in the variable set reduction. Should
be a SMALL number (10 or 20 trees) in order to create the maximum disparity
in variable importance between informative and uninformative predictors
(recommendations taken from Chipman et al. 2010).}

\item{iter.plot}{How many iterations to use in the first diagnostic plot}

\item{full}{If this is set to FALSE (by default), this runs a stepwise
variable set reduction and returns a model with the optimal variable step -
much like gbm::gbm.step() or similar functions. In running varimp.step() it
generates a single plot of RMSE against variables dropped. If this is set to
TRUE, it also runs summary() on the model, and two additional plots are
generated: the initial variable importance diagnostic generated by
[varimp.diag()] (this is SLOW), and a final variable importance bar chart
for the final model.}
}
\value{
Returns a model object run with the optimal, reduced variable set.
}
\description{
A wrapper for a few core functions, including a few diagnostic plots of
variable importance, and the automated stepwise variable set reduction
algorithm.
