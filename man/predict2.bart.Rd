\usage{
predict2.bart(
  object,
  x.layers,
  quantiles = c(),
  ri.data = NULL,
  ri.name = NULL,
  ri.pred = FALSE,
  splitby = 1,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A BART model objector riBART model object generated by the
`dbarts` package}

\item{x.layers}{An object of class `RasterStack`}

\item{quantiles}{Include the extraction of quantiles
(e.g. 5\% and 95\% credible interval) from the posterior}

\item{ri.data}{If 'object' is a riBART model, this gives either one
consistent value (e.g. a prediction year) or a RasterLayer for the random
effect}

\item{ri.name}{The name of the random intercept in the riBART model}

\item{ri.pred}{Should the random intercept be *included* in the prediction
value or dropped? Defaults to FALSE (treats the random intercept as noise
to be excluded)}

\item{splitby}{If set to a value higher than 1, will split your dataset into
approximately n divisible chunks}

\item{quiet}{No progress bars}
}
\description{
A predict() wrapper for combining BART models with spatial input data, to
generate a Raster or RasterStack of predicted outputs. This now includes the
ability to predict from random intercept models, which can be used to deal
with clustering in space and time of outcome variables!
