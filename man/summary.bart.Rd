\description{
An all-purpose model summary tool, which reports the model call, an AUC value
(the area under the receiver-operator curve), and the optimal threshold based
on the true skill statistic (and return the associated Type I and II error
rates).

There are also four diagnostic plots generated (plots=FALSE to turn off): the
receiver-operator curve; a histogram of fitted values; the
threshold-performance curve, which reports the true skill statistic for a
given cutoff, and has a line at the optimal value; and a dotplot showing the
fitted values split by the threshold and the true y values in the data.

This is currently compatible with rbart objects but returns the AUC and
diagnostics on the model fits WITHOUT THE RANDOM EFFECTS INCORPORATED.
Future versions need to add the option to include random effects, to do an
AUC with/without.
